                    Before we jump into any kind of information about the game itself, it would be nice
                    if we would know something about the website as a construct/project. <b>Final Fantasy Tryout</b>
                    in it's origin was just a simple console application, that used to be an exercise for the developer's
                    programming courses. The project start date was July / 2019 and it's development process was about 2-3 months.
                    But the project was actually far from done. After a while, it Merged into <b>Final Fantasy Tryout Goes Web</b>(FF Goes Web for short)
                    by adding website functionality and some actual visualization of the game content. At this state, the game is just a fan-reproduction of the first
                    expansion of Final Fantasy, but there is a lot of distinctive content that wait's to see light. Like Final Fantasy, this game type is RPG, but with an
                    integrated <a href="#Socail"><em>Social System</em></a>, which means its something like a Gaming Facebook(not really though). The graphical content currently
                    is NOT my possession and is NOT used for commercial uses, but as mentioned above, content will be added.

                            Great! We are finally getting to the fun part! The game logic is made to be as simple as a rock : you hit, you get hit, and you try to
                            kill before you get killed. These actions happen every Turn since the game is Turn-Based. In order to experience this marvelous joy (without animations and awesome graphics tho...),

                            It's obvious that you need health to live and that health regeneration recovers health, but let's jump into some details about each attribute:

                                    As the formula follows : Your Attack - Enemy's Armor = Damage Dealt.
                                    The Primary Stats for Attack Power are Strength and Agility.

                                    Something like this : Enemy's Attack - Your Armor = Damage Taken (with protection).
                                    Important! If your Armor is higher than the Enemy's Attack, you will Block the Attack, meaming you won't recieve any Damage from it.
                                    This also means that your Current Armor will be decreased by a percent.

                                    Like the Armor but a little different : Enemy's Magic Power - Your Ressistance = Damage Taken (with protection).
                                    Important! If your Ressistance is higher than the Enemy's Magic Power, you will Absorb the Spell, meaming you won't recieve any Damage from it.
                                    This also means that your Current Ressistance will be decreased by a percent.

                                    In addition : Every time you Level Up you will have the opportunity to choose following points : Strength, Intellect, Spirit, Stamina or Agility.

                                    There are 3 types of Energy : the Common Energy (the electric icon) which has 30 points and regenerates every 4 min,
                                    Crafting Energy (the hammer icon) which has 10 points and also regenerates every 4 min
                                    and PvP Energy (the raised fist icon) which has 15 points and regenerates every 8 min.

                        Spells are the reason you have Mana : Dealing tons of damage in one hit, Healing yourself constantly or just making the
                        Enemy's Attacks absolutely ineffective. There are a few Main Spell Types : Damage Spells (dividing into Physical and Magical),
                        Healing Spells and Buffs. Damage Spells have the same purpose as Normal Attacks, Healing Spells speak for themselves, but what about
                        Buffs? Well, Buffs can be explained pretty simple : They increase one (or more) of your Primary Attributes values for the rest of the fight.
                        Buffs (Like Damage and Healing Spells) are standalone Spells that require Mana to cast.
                        In addition each Spell can have an Effect that occurs when the Spell is casted.
                        Effects can have the same purpose as Damage Spells, Healing Spells or Buffs, but their effectiveness is comparatively lower in order to keep
                        everything balanced. Buffs and Effects can have possitive and negative (DeBuffs / Negative Effects) side which can target either you, or your Enemy.
                        Note that NOT all Spells require Mana and some of them even require different Attributes as casting Resource.
