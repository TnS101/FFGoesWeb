                    Before we jump into any kind of information about the game itself, it would be nice
                    if we would know something about the website as a construct/project. <b>Final Fantasy Tryout</b>
                    in it's origin was just a simple console application, that used to be an exercise for the developer's
                    programming courses. The project start date was July / 2019 and it's development process was about 2-3 months.
                    But the project was actually far from done. After a while, it Merged into <b>Final Fantasy Tryout Goes Web</b>(FF Goes Web for short)
                    by adding website functionality and some actual visualization of the game content. At this state, the game is just a fan-reproduction of the first
                    expansion of Final Fantasy, but there is a lot of distinctive content that wait's to see light. Like Final Fantasy, this game type is RPG, but with an
                    integrated <a href="#Socail"><em class="secondary-font-color">Social System</em></a>, which means its something like a Gaming Facebook(not really though). The graphical content currently
                    is NOT my possession and is NOT used for commercial uses, but as mentioned above, content will be added.

                    Sweet! We can finally see what the game is actually about after all that reading(I know you haven't read anything from above).
                    In order to that, we must segregate the content into a few categories : <a class="secondary-font-color" href="#Basics"><em>Basics</em></a>,

                        Great! We are finally getting to the fun part! The game logic is made to be as simple as a rock : you hit, you get hit, and you try to
                        kill before you get killed. These actions happen every Turn since the game is Turn-Based. In order to experience this marvelous joy (without animations and awesome graphics tho...),
                        you must <a asp-controller="Unit" asp-action="Create"><em class="secondary-font-color">Create</em></a> a Hero.
                        Explained in details, a Hero has <i class="far fa-heart secondary-font-color">Health</i>,

                        <br />
                        It's obvious that you need health to live and that health regeneration recovers health, but let's jump into some details about each attribute:

                                When your Health reaches zero, you Die and lose half of your Gold. You can use various

                                <i class="fas fa-khanda">Attack</i> is used to deal Physical Damage to your Enemy.
                                As the formula follows : Your Attack - Enemy's Armor = Damage Dealt.

                                Same as your Attack but : Your Magic Power - Enemy's Ressistance = Damage Dealt.

                                Something like this : Enemy's Attack - Your Armor = Damage Taken (with protection).
                                Important! If your Armor is higher than the Enemy's Attack, you will Block the Attack, meaming you won't recieve any Damage from it.
                                This also means that your Current Armor will be decreased by a percent.

                                Like the Armor but a little different : Enemy's Magic Power - Your Ressistance = Damage Taken (with protection).
                                Important! If your Ressistance is higher than the Enemy's Magic Power, you will Absorb the Spell, meaming you won't recieve any Damage from it.
                                This also means that your Current Ressistance will be decreased by a percent.
